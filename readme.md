# conservation-app

A proof of concept for an application to track progress in conservation of an area through removal of invasive wildlife.

Streamlined interface for field work, identifying and tracking individual species, while collecting data on conservation efforts into a central database and mapping said data through integration with Google Maps.

### Planned Features 

- Mobile app with automatic invasive plant identification and streamlined interface for photographing before/after removal.
- Central database storing geo-tagged data of invasive removals, including date, time, coordinate location, before/after pictures.
- Data visualization through integration with Google Maps, displaying progress in an area through interactive markers containing stored information about each given removal.

### Running

- To view data visualization proof-of-concept, run `start.bat`.
- Server proof-of-concept in development.
- Client application proof-of-concept in development.
